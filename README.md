This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

  

## Instructions

  

### Criteria

  

- You must create a user listing page.

- You do not have to be logged in to see this.

- You must be able to filter by a users name.

- A user must be able to edit their own details.

- You must create a user profile page.

- You do not have to be logged in to see this.

- There must be a section for a users profile image.

- You **do not** need to handle file upload and storage, you can simply store a URL against the user e.g. using [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/api/image.html#avatar) for example.

- There must be a section for a users bio/description.

- There must be a section for a users favourite songs.

- Database columns should include at least: title, artist, genre, rating.

- A user must be able to add/update/remove music.

- (Optional) A user should be able to export/download their favourite music as a JSON file.

- (Optional) Feel free to add other sections to the profile page to flesh it out a bit more.

- A users profile must be viewable by other users.

- (Optional) Make some notes on what else you would've added, changed or liked to have done better if given more time.

  

This is more-or-less a fresh install of NextJS, I've only created an extremely rudamentary signup/login system and file-based database to get you going. As per the installation process, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS is already installed and ready to use.

  

Jest is set up, however unit tests are optional.

  

### Constraints

  

- Please use TypeScript, not JavaScript.

- Don't feel you have to use my attempt at a database, no offense will be taken if you would prefer to use a package e.g. [drizzle-orm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/drizzle-orm) instead. However, **please use a file-based database driver** if you do.

  

Other than that, feel free to use whatever resources you like, whether thats documentation, component libraries or other npm packages to accomplish this practical (within reason, if I see libraries like [this one](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isarray) being used...ðŸ˜‘). There isn't a time limit on this, spend as little or as much time as you like (please don't invest too much, this is still only a practical). I encourage you to show off a bit if applicable (maybe comment where you're showing off so I can properly appreciate its splendor).

  

### What we're looking for in this practical

  

- Where/how you abstract logic/UI into components.

- Good architectural principles like abstraction layers.

- Attention to detail.

  

## Getting Started

  

Fork this repository into your own.

  

First, install dependencies:

  

```bash

npm  i

```

  

next, initialise the app:

(this script is set up to work on Linux based systems, all it does is set the project root directory based on your local filesystem, you can adjust the script or do this manually yourself if this doesn't work out of the box)

  

```bash

npm  run  init

```

  

run the development server:

  

```bash

npm  run  dev

```

  

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

  

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

  

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

  

## Submission

  

Once you are happy with your work, open a pull request back into the source repository to be reviewed. It will be reviewed the day before your interview, so feel free to push changes once the pull request is opened.


You will be emailed a link within 24 hours of your virtual technical interview.

**Please ensure the following**:
- We will be using your application in production mode, so please ensure your application builds successfully when `npm run build` is executed.
  - We will attempt dev-mode if production mode doesn't work for whatever reason, however, tut-tut-tut. If we think there is enough time, we will try to give you an opportunity to fix any build errors.
- **Your practical should require no additional setup outside of running `npm run build` and `npm run start`.**
- Please make sure your database files are committed so we can use your application as you were using it.
- Please include any relevant environment variables required for your practical to work in a `.env.submission` file.

### Rashid's PR Notes:
Installation:
`npm i`

The following will create dummy users in the database:

Setting up Prisma schema
`npx prisma db push`

Seeding the db
`npx prisma db seed`

Viewing the database stucture and content
`npx prisma studio`

Dropping database
`npx prisma migrate reset --skip-seed`

Login and Sign-up work as expected with the exception of not having any validations in place, the plan was to add some basic Zod validations on the backend (server components) and frontend (to convey to user what the issue is) but I didn't get to it unfortunately. The sign-up page is also missing the 'bio' textarea, which I realised a bit too late, but which can be updated using the user profile edit page. 

I have written a new authentication mechanism using oslojs, argon2 and prisma. 

Once logged in, only the first two header navbar links are currently working and the Signout link (clicking on the image on the top right hand corner). 

The users page lists all the users (dummy and newly created accounts) with their names and emails. Other fields can be easily added should one decide to do so. A rather large table (consisting of 8 files) is being used to display the users. The table is sortable and filterable (by user name). The three dots (...) controls for each user brings up a dropdown consising of viewing, updating and deleting the user, but only the updating currently works. 

It's a very rough application missing proper validation, error handling, clean file architecture and solid data typing. Due to time limitations, this is the best I could do in 2 days.
